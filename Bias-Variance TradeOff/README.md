## Bias-Variance TradeOff

The bias-variance tradeoff is a fundamental concept in machine learning, particularly in the context of model performance and generalization. It deals with finding the right balance between two types of errors that contribute to the total error of a model: bias and variance.

**Bias:**
Bias refers to the error introduced by approximating a real-world problem with a simplified model. It represents the difference between the average prediction of our model and the correct value we are trying to predict.
High bias can cause underfitting, where the model is too simplistic to capture the underlying structure of the data. It may fail to learn the patterns in the training data, leading to poor performance not only on the training set but also on unseen data.

**Variance:**
Variance refers to the model's sensitivity to fluctuations in the training set. It measures how much the predictions for a given point vary between different realizations of the model trained on different training sets.
High variance can cause overfitting, where the model learns noise and irrelevant patterns from the training data, capturing the random fluctuations instead of the underlying trends. As a result, it performs well on the training set but poorly on unseen data.
The bias-variance tradeoff arises because decreasing bias often increases variance and vice versa. Finding the right balance between bias and variance is crucial for building models that generalize well to unseen data.

**In the context of my code:**

The bias is calculated as the mean squared error (MSE) between the predicted values and the actual values on the training set.
The variance is calculated similarly but on the test set.
The plotBiasVarianceGraph function plots the bias and variance against the complexity of the model (degree of polynomial). It helps visualize how changing the model complexity affects bias and variance.
Typically, you'll observe the following behavior:

As the model complexity (degree of polynomial) increases:
Bias tends to decrease because the model can better fit the training data.
Variance tends to increase because the model becomes more sensitive to small fluctuations in the training data.
There's a point where bias and variance are both minimized, resulting in the optimal model complexity for the given problem. Beyond this point, increasing the complexity leads to overfitting, where variance dominates and performance on unseen data deteriorates.
By analyzing the bias-variance tradeoff, you can make informed decisions about model complexity and regularization techniques to achieve better generalization performance.
