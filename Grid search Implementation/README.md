# Grid Search

Grid search is a hyperparameter optimization technique used to search for the optimal combination of hyperparameters for a given model by evaluating the model's performance on a grid of hyperparameter values. It involves defining a grid of hyperparameters and exhaustively evaluating the model's performance for each combination of hyperparameters.

Here's a high-level explanation of grid search:

Define Grid: Define a grid of hyperparameters to search over. Each hyperparameter is assigned a set of values to explore.

Grid Search: For each combination of hyperparameters in the grid:

Train the model using the current combination of hyperparameters.
Evaluate the model's performance using cross-validation or a separate validation set.
Record the performance metric (such as accuracy, loss, or other evaluation metrics) for the current combination of hyperparameters.
Select Best Model: After evaluating all combinations, select the combination of hyperparameters that resulted in the best performance metric.

## In the context of your code:

Define Grid: The grid consists of the possible values of b1 and b2, ranging from -1 to 1 with a step size of 0.01.

Grid Search: The minimize_epsilon function performs grid search by iterating over each combination of b1 and b2 values in the defined grid.

For each combination, it calculates the total error (epsilon) by summing the absolute differences between the actual output and the output predicted by the linear model using the current b1 and b2 values.
It records the epsilon value for each combination.
Select Best Model: After evaluating all combinations, the function selects the combination of b1 and b2 that resulted in the minimum epsilon value. This combination represents the optimal model parameters that minimize the error for the given dataset.

Grid search provides a systematic approach to find the optimal hyperparameters for a model by exhaustively searching through a predefined grid of hyperparameter values. In your code, it helps to identify the optimal b1 and b2 values that minimize the error, allowing you to fit the best linear model to the dataset.
